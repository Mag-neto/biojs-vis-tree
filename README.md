BioJS Phylogenetic Tree Package
=========

This library currently consists of a copy of the modern version of [tnt](https://github.com/emepyc/tnt) mainly developed by Miguel Pignatelli.
Currently we can compile the code with 

```
make lib/tnt.js
```

A documentation can be found [here](http://emepyc.github.io/tnt/). 
All kudos goes to Miguel by starting and making this library awesome.
